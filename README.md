# admin-dashboard
An admin dashboard made with CSS Flex and Grid

This project is all about styling - breaking up content into grids and flex boxes mostly.  It's a lot of work to nest grids and flexbox containers and get everything looking how you want.  But this is such a standard practice in web design that you need to get used to it ASAP! :grin:
